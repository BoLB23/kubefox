# Overview

KubeFox is an SDK, platform and infrastructure to enable rapid construction and
deployment of secure and robust applications for Kubernetes, and which
drastically reduces the burden of DevOps.  

Consider the following list:

- Virtual environments
- Zero Trust
- Versioned deployments
- Federated metrics, tracing, logging, auditing, and monitoring – out of the box

Environments transform into lightweight virtual constructs, still possessing the
positive attributes that we expect of them, but shedding undesirable traits that
make them unwieldy.  Zero Trust is not something that requires thousands of
dollars and large, high caliber DevOps teams - it’s an intrinsic property of a
KubeFox-developed system.  Multiple versions of applications can be run
side-by-side, facilitating Canary and Blue/Green deployments and drastically
simplifying the software lifecycle.  Developers are freed to rapidly evolve and
advance applications, without jumping through complex configuration hoops or
waiting in line for resources.  

With minimal configuration, KubeFox yields advanced telemetry - including
federated, span-based logs, metrics and traces - on user-developed components,
and on a by-component and component-to-component basis.  KubeFox orchestrates
unheard of efficiencies, yielding provisioning efficiencies and driving down
costs.  Sound intriguing?  Read on…
